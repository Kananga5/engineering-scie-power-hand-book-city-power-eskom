SDGs and electrotechnology: driving sustainable development
Date & Time
Selected Sessions:
Apr 25, 2024 13:00
Description
In the pursuit of a sustainable future, the United Nations (UN) has outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that serve as a roadmap to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems are instrumental in facilitating sustainable solutions across multiple sectors, including energy, transportation, and health. They provide a framework for establishing best practices, fostering technological advancements, and ensuring the reliability and safety of electrotechnical products and systems. This webinar discussion launches the IEC Academy’s latest webinar series - titled "IEC and the SDGs: partnering for a safe, efficient and inclusive future". Panellists will explore how various aspects of electrotechnology, such as renewable energy, smart grids, and digitalization, contribute to achieving specific SDGs outlined by the UN.
